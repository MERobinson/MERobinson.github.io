We’ll cover from s. This site will remain active if you want to go through it at your own pace and I’m planning to continue developing it to provide further depth and introduce other bioinformatics topics in the future. Hopefully this will prove a useful resource for the department, if you have any ideas/requests let me know! Contact Any questions drop me an email at my imperial address - m.robinson "],
["01.1_setup.html", "1 System Setup", " 1 System Setup For the current tutorial we’ll be using R. R is a statistical programming language commonly used in bioinformatics. R can be run from the command line but here we’ll be using an interface - refered to as an integrated development environment (IDE) - called RStudio. Before we start we need to make sure R, RStudio and some extra packages within R are installed. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system below to setup everything you need for the tutorial. 1.0.1 R For Mac OS X: Go to CRAN and download the instalation package appropriate for your OS and simply follow the instructions. For Windows: Go here -&gt; ‘Download R for Windows’ -&gt; ‘base’ -&gt; ‘Download R3.4.1 for Windows’. The installer will take you through setup. For Ubuntu: Through the software center - just search for r-base and install. At the command line: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install r-base 1.0.2 RStudio To get RStudio simply go here, download the installer appropriate for your system and follow the instructions. "]
