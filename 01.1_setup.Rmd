# System Setup

For the current tutorial we'll be using **R**. R is a statistical programming language commonly used in bioinformatics.

R can be run from the command line but here we'll be using an interface - refered to as an integrated development environment (IDE) - called **RStudio**.

Before we start we need to make sure R, RStudio and some extra packages within R are installed. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system below to setup everything you need for the tutorial. 

### R 

  * For Mac OS X: 

    Go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and download the instalation package appropriate for your OS and simply follow the instructions.

  * For Windows:

    Go [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/) -> 'Download R for Windows' -> 'base' -> 'Download R3.4.1 for Windows'. The installer will take you through setup. 

  * For Ubuntu:

    Through the software center - just search for r-base and install.

    At the command line:
```{bash, eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install r-base
```

### RStudio
