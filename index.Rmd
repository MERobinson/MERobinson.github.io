# Preface {-}

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce bioinformatics to complete beginners in a practical and accessible way. We'll cover from s. 

This site will remain active if you want to go through it at your own pace and I'm planning to continue developing it to provide further depth and introduce other bioinformatics topics in the future. Hopefully this will prove a useful resource for the department, if you have any ideas/requests let me know!
